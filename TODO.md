# Blank Comparison
- click button to take blank reading
- click next button to read final
- backend compares each blank pixel value against final read
- absorbance = log(final/blank)

# Wavelength
- use equation to map wavelengths to pixels
- display wavelength instead of pixels on x axis
- future: automatic calibration by shining laser of each frequency at each location
